## Communications using public-key cryptography

- symmetric algorithm is like a safe and the key is the combination
- Diffie and Hellman in 1976 described public-key cryptgraphy.
- They used two kinds of keys, a public and a private key
- Computationally it's hard to deduce the private and public key
- Everybody can encrypt the message but only a person who have the private key can decrypt it.
- Mathematically encryption is the easy direction, anyone can encrypt the message with the public key.
- For the decrytion you need a secret, the private key, which makes the decrytion as easy as encrypting.
- Every network user has it's own public key and private key, and public keys are published in some database.
